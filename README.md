# RPG

This project is a culmination that allowed me to learn JAVA and put forward my knowledge.
Make a 2D adventure RPG was like a dream for me so I make one :D .

The whole project was realized in JAVA by Wassim MESFIOUI.
Through this project, I have been able to implement my various computer skills, whether for the adaptation of the tiles with the LibreSprite software, the adaptation of the musics and the sounds with Audacity, or the creation of maps with Tiled.

I was also able to put my creative skills into play, whether for the creation of a story but also for the drawing of the different characters and their animations.

all therme 'I', 'ME', concerns Wassim MESFIOUI.

I would like to thank :
- Magiscarf: Original creator of the exterior tiles
- Demise-Hawk: Original creator of the interior tiles
- xDeviruchi: Original creator of 8bit fight music
- SVL: Original creator of the RPG musical atmosphere


This project will remain at the stage of an Alpha for the moment.
At the current stage, we can already have an idea of the possible functionalities.
